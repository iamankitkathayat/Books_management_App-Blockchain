# Communicating blockchain with the front-end(used Next.js framework)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Go inside client folder, which is a Next.js-app, then
npm run dev

To compile the library contract:
npx hardhat compile

To deploy the contract:
npx hardhat run scripts/library.js

To test the contract with unit tests
npx hardhat test test/library.js

To run a node
npx hardhat node

```
LibraryManagement contract deployed to "0xdA1BE7Fe39b9DC428247b08C95094842D3FCE332";
